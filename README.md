# container-perf-tools

This project contains a set of containerized performance test tools that can be used in Kubernetes environment to 
evaluate performance related to data plane, such as dpdk enabled network throughput, real time kernel latency, 
etc.

There are two ways to use these tools:
+ all-in-one test container - A single container that includes all test tools
+ standalone test containers - A separate container for each test tool

## All-in-one test container

### Directory layout

The Dockerfile file under the root directory defines the all-in-one container.

The all-in-one container is constructed in such a way that the tester has the flexiblity to customize a tool execution 
without rebuilding the container image. 

For the all-in-one container, it's expected each tool will be located in its own directory with name cmd.sh. For example 
under directory cyclictest, the cmd.sh is the entrance for cyclictest. For testpmd there will be a directory testpmd with 
cmd.sh under that directory. The tool script should expect its arguments/options via enviroment variables.

The run.sh under the repo root directory is the entrance for the container image. Once it is started, it will execute the
specified tool based on the yaml specification, with the environment variables in the yaml file. The yaml examples for k8s
(OpenShift) can be found under the sample-yamls/ directory

### Building the container

Build the all-in-one container image:
`podman build -t <your repo tag> -f Dockerfile .`

### common yaml variables for the all-in-one test container

All the test scripts use enviroment variables as input. There are two types of variables, the first type is common 
to all tools when run from the all-in-one test container. The second type is tool specific. Both are defined as
name/value pairs under the container env spec.

The common env variables include:
+ tool: which performance test to run, essentially it is one of the tool directory names

The tool specific variables will be mentioned under each tool section.

## Stand-alone test containers

### Directory layout

Each test tool can also be built as a standalone test container (versus included in the all-in-one container). Some of the
dockerfiles can be found under the root directory, such as Dockerfile-cyclictest and Dockerfile-oslat. Other standalone test
containers may have their dockerfiles located in the individual sub directories, such as the standalone-testpmd and
standalone-trafficgen containers. To build those containers one needs to go to the individual directory and run podman build.

### Building the container

For example, to build the oslat container image:
`podman build -t <your repo tag> -f Dockerfile-oslat .`

## Running the tests

### General notes

There are two types of container tool use cases. The first type is to run the performance tool as container
image in a Kubernetes cluster and the performance tool will collect and report performance metrics of the
underlying system; this type includes sysjitter, cyclictest, and uperf. The second type lives outside Kubernetes
cluster and is used externally to evaluate the Kubernetes cluster; this type includes trex trafficgen. Sometimes
we need to use these two types together to evaluate the system; for example, to evaluate the SRIOV throughput, we
can run a DPDK testpmd container inside Kubernetes cluster, and outside the cluster use trex trafficgen
container to do binary search in order to evaluate the highest throughput supported by the SRIOV ports.

### Running as pods

The tests can all be run in pods on an OpenShift kubernetes cluster (this is the recommended method). Sample yaml
files for each test can be found under the sample-yamls directory. Some examples:
* oslat: [pod_oslat.yaml](sample-yamls/pod_oslat.yaml)
* cyclictest: [pod_cyclictest.yaml](sample-yamls/pod_cyclictest.yaml)
* hwlatdetect: [pod_hwlatdetect.yaml](sample-yamls/pod_hwlatdetect.yaml)

By default, these yaml files point to the pre-built stand-alone container images under the [container-perf-tools](https://quay.io/organization/container-perf-tools) organization on quay.io.

When the test is complete, to get the test result, use "oc logs" or "kubectl logs" command to examine the 
container log. Currently there is a work in progress to kick off the test and present the test result via 
rest API.

### Running from podman

Alternatively, some of the tests can be run from podman directly. Here is an example of running oslat with podman:

```
# podman run -it --rm --privileged -v /dev/cpu_dma_latency:/dev/cpu_dma_latency --cpuset-cpus 4-11 -e PRIO=1 -e RUNTIME_SECONDS=10 quay.io/jianzzha/oslat

## Test Configuration

### uperf test 

uperf test involves two containers, a master and a worker. The master needs to know the ip address of the worker. This means 
the worker needs to be started first. The ip address of the slave will be entered as input value for env
variable "uperfSlave" in the master yaml file. In sample-yamls/pod-uperf-master.yaml, a variable is used as the 
"uperfSlave" value and this is to make the automation easier, for example the worker and master can be started like this,
```
#!/usr/bin/bash
if ! oc get pod uperf-slave 1>&2 2>/dev/null; then
	oc create -f pod-uperf-slave.yaml
fi
oc delete pod uperf-master 2>/dev/null

while true; do
	status=$(oc get pods uperf-slave -o json | jq -r '.status.phase')
	if [[ "${status}" == "Running" ]]; then
		break
	fi
	sleep 5s
done
export slave=$(oc get pods uperf-slave -o json | jq -r '.status.podIP')
envsubst < pod-uperf-master.yaml | oc create -f -
```
uperf supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: uperf, run this uperf tool
+ uperfSlave: the ip address of the worker pod
+ size: the tcp write buffer size
+ threads: number of threads 

### oslat test

oslat is a userspace polling mode stress program to detect OS level latency.

oslat supports the following environment variables:
+ RUNTIME_SECONDS: test duration in seconds; default 10
+ PRIO: RT priority used for the test threads; default 1
+ manual: choice of y/n; if enabled, don't kick off oslat, this is for debug purpose
+ delay: specify how many second to delay before test start; default 0
+ TRACE_THRESHOLD: stop the oslat test when threshold triggered (in usec); no default
+ EXTRA_ARGS (default "", will be passed directly to oslat command)

### cyclictest test

cyclictest is used to evaluate the real time kernel scheduler latency. 

cyclictest supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: cyclictest, run this cyclictest tool
+ DURATION: how long the cyclictest will be run, default: 24 hours
+ INTERVAL: set cyclictest -i parameter, default 1000
+ stress: choice of false/stress-ng
+ rt_priority: which rt priority is used to run the cyclictest; default 1
+ delay: specify how many seconds to delay before test start; default 0
+ TRACE_THRESHOLD: stop the cyclictest when threshold triggered (in usec); no default
+ EXTRA_ARGS (default "", will be passed directly to cyclictest command)

### stress-ng test

stress-ng is used to load and stress cpus

stress-ng supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: stress-ng, run this stress-ng tool
+ DURATION: how long the stress-ng will be run, default: 24 hours
+ CPU_METHOD: specify a cpu stress method, default: matrixprod
+ CPU_LOAD: load each CPU with P percent loading, default: 100
+ EXTRA_ARGS (default "", will be passed directly to stress-ng command)

### sysjitter test

sysjitter is used to evaluate the system scheduler jitter. This test in certain way can predict the zero loss 
throughput for high speed network.

sysjitter supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: sysjitter, run this sysjitter tool
+ RUNTIME_SECONDS: how many seconds to run the sysjitter test, default 10 seconds
+ THRESHOLD_NS: default 200 ns
+ DISABLE_CPU_BALANCE: choice of y/n; if enabled, the cpu that runs sysjitter will have workload balance disabled
+ USE_TASKSET: choice of y/n; if enabled, use taskset to pin the task cpu
+ manual: choice of y/n; if enabled, don't kick off sysjitter, this is for debug purpose

### testpmd test

testpmd is used to evaluate the system networking performance. The container expects two data ports (other than 
the default interface) and wires the two ports together via dpdk handling. For higher performance, the testpmd 
runs in io mode and it doesn't examine the packets and simply forwards packets from one port to another port,
in each direction. In general, testpmd forwarding is assumed not to be a bottleneck for the end to end 
throughput test.

testpmd supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: testpmd, run this testpmd tool
+ ring_size: ring buffer size, default 2048
+ manual: choice of y/n; if enabled, don't kick off testpmd, this is for debug purpose 

For more information, refer to the [standalone-testpmd directory](https://github.com/redhat-nfvpe/container-perf-tools/tree/master/standalone-testpmd)

### trafficgen test

trafficgen is used to perform a binary search and find the maximum sustainable throughput. This tool expects 
two data ports (other than the default interface) and sends the traffic out of one port and expects the traffic 
received on the other port and vice versa. It begins at line rate and automatically adjust the traffic rate 
for next iteration based on the packet loss ratio at last iteration until it finds a traffic rate this has 
packet loss ratio meets the expectation.

This tool supports the following environment variables:
+ tool: trafficgen, run this trafficgen tool
+ pci_list: A comma-seperated data port pci address list, for example 0000:03:00.0,0000:03:00.1
+ validation_seconds: The final validation test duration, default 30 seconds
+ search_seconds: The test duration for each search iteration, default 10 seconds
+ sniff_seconds: The initial test duration before binary search begins, default 10 seconds
+ loss_ratio: Expected packet loss ration percentile, default 0.002
+ flows: Number of flows, default 1
+ frame_size: The packet frame size (layer 2 frame), default 64 bytes

Prerequisites:
+ 2MB or 1GB huge pages
+ Isolated CPU for better performance
+ Example kargs: `default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8 intel_iommu=on iommu=pt isolcpus=4-11`

Podman run example:
`podman run -it --rm --privileged  -v /sys:/sys -v /dev:/dev -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules --cpuset-cpus 4-11 -e tool=trafficgen -e pci_list=0000:03:00.0,0000:03:00.1  -e validation_seconds=10 quay.io/jianzzha/perf-tools`
